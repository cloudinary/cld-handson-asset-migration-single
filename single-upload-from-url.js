const cloudinary = require('cloudinary').v2;

/* 
In this example we are using:
 * `use_filename: true` to instruct Cloudinary to use the file name of the asset being uploaded to produce asset public_id on upload
	- `iss050e066094~orig` ⇒ `iss050e066094_orig`
	
 * `unique_filename: false` to prevent Cloudinary from adding unique suffix to the public_id of the uploaded asset
 	- This way public_id matches the original asset’s file name as closely as possible 

 * `asset_type: auto` to let the Cloudinary back-end determine the type of the asset ( `image`, `video` or `raw` ) on upload
 	- This way we do not need to maintain logic in the migration routine to determine type for each asset before upload 

 Note that in public_id cloudinary replaced `~` with `_`. More details on this behavior here:
 https://support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001317409--Legal-naming-conventions
